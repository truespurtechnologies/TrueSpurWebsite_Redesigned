  },
  {
    q: "Does Clinax support multiple branches?",
    a: "Yes. Clinax is designed to grow from a single branch to a multi-branch, multi-specialty organisation. Patients, teams and dashboards can be viewed per branch or across the whole clinic.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who can see what? How is access controlled?",
    a: "Access is role-based. Reception, therapists and leadership each get the views and actions relevant to their work, and you decide who can access which branches and records.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do we have to replace all our existing tools on day one?",
    a: "No. Implementation starts with your priority workflows — typically front desk and scheduling, then clinical documentation, then dashboards — so teams adopt Clinax step by step.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does onboarding take?",
    a: "It depends on branches and scope, but the approach is the same: discover and align, configure, onboard by role, go live with support. Most clinics start on the front desk and scheduling within weeks, not months.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Clinax adapt to our clinic's workflows?",
    a: "Clinax is configured around your priority workflows, branches and roles during onboarding, rather than forcing your clinic into a fixed structure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Clinax only for physiotherapy?",
    a: "Clinax is built for physiotherapy and rehabilitation clinics first, with structured clinical workflows for that setting — and designed so clinics can extend into additional specialties over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we import our existing patient list?",
    a: "Yes. Existing patient details from spreadsheets or exports are imported during configuration so reception is not re-typing records on day one.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about WhatsApp reminders and payments?",
    a: "Patient communication and payment integrations are scoped with you during discovery, alongside the core clinic workflows — we don't assume a specific provider in advance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is our patient data secure?",
    a: "Yes. Patient records are encrypted in transit and at rest, access is role-based so staff only see what their work requires, and your data is backed up automatically. You retain full ownership and can export your data at any time.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is Clinax priced?",
    a: "Pricing is scoped to your clinic — branches, roles and the workflows you switch on first — rather than a one-size-fits-all plan. We walk through it during the demo so you can weigh it against the tools and hours it replaces.",
